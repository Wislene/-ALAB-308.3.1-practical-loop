// Part 1: Fizz Buzz

// Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100.
// If a number is divisible by 3, log “Fizz.”
// If a number is divisible by 5, log “Buzz.”
// If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log “Fizz Buzz.”
// If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, log the number.

//  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
//   if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) console.log("Fizz Buzz");
//   else if (i % 3 === 0) console.log("Fizz");
//  else if (i % 5 === 0) console.log("Buzz");
//  else console.log(i);
// }

// Part 2:

// Write a script that accomplishes the following:
// Declare an arbitrary number, n.

// Create a loop that searches for the next prime number, starting at n and incrementing from there.

// Start from given number loop up until next prime number

// As soon as you find the prime number, log that number and exit the loop.

// Continuing with the example above, if n is equal to 4, your loop should log 5. Similarly,

// if n is 5, it should log 7, and if n is 9, it should log 11. Test your loop with higher numbers and reference an online prime number table to determine the accuracy of your code.

// 1 is not a prime
// A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itselt and 1 without any remainders.

// A number that cannot be divided by any precious number (ex =5 5 should not be divisible by 4, 3, 2, 2, 1)

// Declare a variable (any variable)

const num = 9;
mainloop: for (let i = num; i < 100; i++) {
  if (num === 1) continue mainloop;

  for (let j = num; j > 1; j--) {
    if (i % j === 0) continue mainloop;
  }
  console.log(i);
  break;
}
